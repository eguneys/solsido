> The duration of a note is specified by a number after the note name: 1 for a whole note, 2 for a half note, 4 for a quarter note and so on. Beams are added automatically.

> If you do not specify a duration, the previous duration is used for the next note. The duration of the first note defaults to a quarter note.
